App Idea:
I would like to build a gym workout social media app. It would consist of a feed where people could upload gym progress pictures and new PR's. Additionally, they could have a user profile storing all their workouts. Users can add friends and send them daily reminders to workout. They can also celebrate/like each other's workouts and send encouragement. There could also be a discover page that allows people to find workout buddies near them.
